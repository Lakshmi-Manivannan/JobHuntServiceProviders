Working at a job, vocation or career is one of the critical pieces for most of our lives. A
job provides income that we need to pay for our basic needs such as food, clothing, and
a place to live. For this full time job a person has to spend approximately seven to eight
hours. When it comes to part time job a person can spend two to four hours of his free
time to do any small chores that pays him. In offline job hunting, people have to search
through print and visual media and in online job hunting; people can easily search and
find jobs based on their skills and qualifications. Both in offline and online job hunting
people can easily search for full time jobs, when it comes to part-time jobs, there is no
proper platform where they can search any chore/jobs easily and the opportunities is
very less for part time jobs compared to full time jobs. To solve this real time problem
we are developing an application where people can easily find part time jobs and get
paid for it. People can register themselves by providing their details and skills they have.
Whenever a need for small work is requested from users, the skilled service provider can
solve the problem and get paid for their work. People requests the service based on the
location they live in, which is much easier to find a small work when service providers
are in need for money. For example, whenever a user requests for some service like
laptop service, the request is sent to all the service providers of a userâ€™s location. If any
service provider is available and accepts the request, then the request is not sent to
other service providers of other locations, else the request is sent to other locations to
provide quicker service to users.
